        Traffic Jam refers to a long line of vehicles on the road 
        leading to a serious roadblock. It is a common feature of 
        the major roads of Bangladesh. It is also seen in the town
         or even rural roads. There are some causes behind this Firs
         tly, many drivers are ignorant of traffic rules while some
          deliberately violate traffic rules. This leads to a serious r
          oadblock. Again, plying of various vehicles with different 
          velocities causes traffic jams. The vehicles with high speed are sometimes blocked by vehicles with less speed. In, traffic jams are largely occurred due to thousands of rickshaws plying on the busy roads. Besides, sometimes water clogged on the road leads to traffic jams. Finally. poor driving, reckless parking alongside pavements, and unhealthy competition among drivers cause a traffic jam. I feel bored at the time of a traffic jam. It can be removed by maintaining traffic rules strongly as well as making drivers conscious about following these rules.
